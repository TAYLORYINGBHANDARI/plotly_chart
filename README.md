# Plotly_chart
# Belly Button Research visualization
* use  JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js 
*  create horizontal bar chart, gauge chart, bubble chart 

## Background
Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive dashboard, a creative visualization that offers interactivity which can help the audience better understand the data and draw the same conclusions as researchers and data analyst.
The research and data file provided holds data of 153 individuals and their:

* Unique and anonymous IDs
* Demographic details
* Belly button scrubbing frequency
* Belly button biological “footprint”


## Results

* Link to Plotly_chart  webpage
The deployed webpage is accessible at 
https://tayloryingbhandari.github.io/plotly_chart/

* Horizontal Bar chart:
display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage.
Displaying the otu_labels value as the hover value on the bar chart.
* Bubble chart:
 A chart that will display the Bacteria culture per ID, when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage.
* Gauge chart:
A chart that is displaying  the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.
